C++ Projects Presentation
=========================

1\. Snake Game
--------------

A classic Snake game implemented in C++ using simple console graphics. It involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls or itself. This project is a great way to learn about game logic and input/output handling.

2\. Tic Tac Toe Game
--------------------

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project is great for practicing conditional statements and loops.

3\. Guess the Number
--------------------

A C++ program where the computer generates a random number, and the player needs to guess it. It provides feedback to the player, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. This project helps in understanding random number generation and basic user input/output.

4\. Calculator
--------------

A simple calculator program implemented in C++ that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It demonstrates the use of functions and conditional statements to handle user input and perform calculations.

5\. Rock Paper Scissors
-----------------------

A C++ game where the player competes against the computer in the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. It randomly selects one of the three options and compares it with the player's choice to determine the winner. This project is a fun way to practice conditional statements and random number generation.

6\. Power Options to Shut Down the PC
-------------------------------------

A C++ program that provides options to shut down, restart, or log off the computer. It utilizes system commands or APIs to perform these actions based on user input. This project introduces system-level programming concepts and interacting with the operating system.

7\. Hangman Game
----------------

A console-based Hangman game implemented in C++ where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. Incorrect guesses result in drawing parts of a hangman figure, with the game ending if the hangman is fully drawn or the word is guessed correctly. This project enhances knowledge of strings and loops.

8\. Number System Converter
---------------------------

A C++ program that converts numbers between different number systems, such as binary to decimal and vice versa. It involves implementing algorithms to convert numbers and handling user input to select the conversion type. This project is useful for understanding number representations and algorithms.

9\. Monster Fight
-----------------

A text-based game in C++ where the player controls a character battling against various monsters. The player can choose actions like attack, defend, or use items during battles. This project integrates game mechanics with object-oriented programming concepts.

10\. Student Grade System
-------------------------

A C++ program to manage student grades, allowing users to input and store student information along with their grades for different subjects. It provides functionalities like calculating average grades and generating reports. This project demonstrates concepts of file handling and data structures.

11\. Palindrome Using Stack
---------------------------

A C++ program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not using a stack data structure. It involves pushing characters onto the stack and then popping them to compare with the original string. This project enhances understanding of stacks and string manipulation.

12\. Numbers to Words
---------------------

A C++ program that converts numerical digits into their corresponding English words. For example, 123 would be converted to "one hundred twenty-three". It involves implementing algorithms to parse and convert numbers into words. This project improves skills in string manipulation and algorithms.
